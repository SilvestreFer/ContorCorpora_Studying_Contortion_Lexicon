#üìö ContorCorpora: A Contortion-Focused Text Corpus
ContorCorpora is a web scraping and data processing project designed to collect, clean, and compile textual data from online sources focused on contortion, flexibility, and stretching techniques. The resulting corpora support research in linguistics, natural language processing (NLP), and corpus studies.

##üéØ Goals
Automatically extract high-quality textual data from contortion-centered web sources
Process and clean the data for linguistic consistency and usability
Store the corpora in structured and accessible formats for analysis

##üõ†Ô∏è Use Case
This repository serves as the technical documentation for the corpus compilation component of my final project in the course Computational Linguistics. 
It includes Python scripts for:
- Data extraction (web scraping and audio transcription)
- Preprocessing and cleaning
- Text organization and export

The project includes both English and Portuguese corpora, used as primary datasets for the final course report.

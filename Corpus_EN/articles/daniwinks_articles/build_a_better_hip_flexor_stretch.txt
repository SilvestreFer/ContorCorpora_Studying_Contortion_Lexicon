# Build a Better Hip Flexor Stretch

If you're like me and have a regular ol' desk job (or maybe you're still a student) and sit around in a chair for 8+ hours a day, odds are your hip flexors - the muscles in front of your hips responsible for hip flexion (ex. drawing your knee into your chest) spend a lot of time in a shortened position. Short/tight hip flexors make it hard for you to fully extend (straighten) from your hips, which make both splits and backbends (remember, back-bending is like front-stretching - so your hip flexors do get stretched in a backbend!) more difficult. So if you're working on back or leg flexibility, spending some quality time stretching your hip flexors is important.

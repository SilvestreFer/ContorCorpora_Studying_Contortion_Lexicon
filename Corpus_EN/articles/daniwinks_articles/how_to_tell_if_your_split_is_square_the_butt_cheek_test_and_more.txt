# How to Tell if Your Split is “Square” (the “Butt Cheek Test” and More!)

Are you keeping your hips square when practicing front splits and lunges? Do you know how to tell? Here are some of the most common ways I like showing students you can check for yourself if your hips are properly “square.”

Why Do We Care About “Square” Splits?

Often when we talk about “square” when we’re stretching we’re referring to the position of our pelvis (our hip bones). In a front split,square hips refers to a neutral pelvic position where both hip bones are pointing forwards like headlights, and the top of the pelvis is close to parallel to the floor(technicallywe can’t have a totally neutral pelvis due to the limited amount our back leg can extend behind us before we need to tilt our pelvis forwards slightly - but for the sake of discussion, think of being able to keep the top of your pelvis as lifted as you can to avoid having to lean forwards). This requires a great deal of flexibility in our hip flexors in our back leg (psssst - need a review of what muscles are invovled in a front split? Check outlast week’s blog post!)
